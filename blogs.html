              <p class="card-text">Computer programming is the process of performing a particular computation (or more generally, 
                accomplishing a specific computing result), usually by designing and building an executable computer program. 
                Programming involves tasks such as analysis, generating algorithms, profiling algorithms' accuracy and resource 
                consumption, and the implementation of algorithms (usually in a chosen programming language, commonly referred to as coding).
                The source code of a program is written in one or more languages that are intelligible to programmers, rather than machine code, 
                which is directly executed by the central processing unit. The purpose of programming is to find a sequence of 
                instructions that will automate the performance of a task (which can be as complex as an operating system) on a computer, 
                often for solving a given problem. Proficient programming thus usually requires expertise in several different subjects, 
                including knowledge of the application domain, specialized algorithms, and formal logic.
                Tasks accompanying and related to programming include testing, debugging, source code maintenance, 
                implementation of build systems, and management of derived artifacts, such as the machine code of computer programs. 
                These might be considered part of the programming process, but often the term software development is used for 
                this larger process with the term programming, implementation, or coding reserved for the actual writing of code. 
                Software engineering combines engineering techniques with software development practices. 
                Reverse engineering is a related process used by designers, analysts, and programmers to understand 
                an existing program and re-implement its function.</p>

              <h5 class="card-title">History of programming</h5>
              <p class="card-text">Programmable devices have existed for centuries. As early as the 9th century, 
                a programmable music sequencer was invented by the Persian Banu Musa brothers, who described an automated mechanical flute 
                player in the Book of Ingenious Devices.
                In 1206, the Arab engineer Al-Jazari invented a programmable drum machine where a musical mechanical automaton could be made to play 
                different rhythms and drum patterns, via pegs and cams. In 1801, the Jacquard loom could produce entirely different weaves by 
                changing the "program" - a series of pasteboard cards with holes punched in them.
                Code-breaking algorithms have also existed for centuries. In the 9th century, the Arab mathematician Al-Kindi described a 
                cryptographic algorithm for deciphering encrypted code, in A Manuscript on Deciphering Cryptographic Messages. He gave the 
                first description of cryptanalysis by frequency analysis, the earliest code-breaking algorithm.
                The first computer program is generally dated to 1843, when mathematician Ada Lovelace published an algorithm to calculate a 
                sequence of Bernoulli numbers, intended to be carried out by Charles Babbage's Analytical Engine.
                Data and instructions were once stored on external punched cards, which were kept in order and arranged in program decks.
                In the 1880s Herman Hollerith invented the concept of storing data in machine-readable form.[10] Later a control panel (plug board) 
                added to his 1906 Type I Tabulator allowed it to be programmed for different jobs, and by the late 1940s, unit record equipment such 
                as the IBM 602 and IBM 604, were programmed by control panels in a similar way, as were the first electronic computers.</p>

              <p class="card-text">Whatever the approach to development may be, the final program must satisfy some fundamental properties. 
                The following properties are among the most important:
                Reliability: how often the results of a program are correct. 
                This depends on conceptual correctness of algorithms and minimization of programming mistakes, 
                such as mistakes in resource management (e.g., buffer overflows and race conditions) and logic errors 
                (such as division by zero or off-by-one errors).
                Robustness: how well a program anticipates problems due to errors (not bugs). This includes situations such as incorrect, 
                inappropriate or corrupt data, unavailability of needed resources such as memory, operating system services, and network connections,
                 user error, and unexpected power outages.
                Usability: the ergonomics of a program: the ease with which a person can use the program for its intended purpose or in 
                some cases even unanticipated purposes. Such issues can make or break its success even regardless of other issues. 
                This involves a wide range of textual, graphical, and sometimes hardware elements that improve the clarity,
                 intuitiveness, cohesiveness and completeness of a program's user interface.
                Portability: the range of computer hardware and operating system platforms on which the source 
                code of a program can be compiled/interpreted and run. This depends on differences in the programming 
                facilities provided by the different platforms, including hardware and operating system resources, 
                expected behavior of the hardware and operating system, and availability of platform-specific compilers 
                (and sometimes libraries) for the language of the source code.
                Maintainability: the ease with which a program can be modified by its present or future developers in order 
                to make improvements or to customize, fix bugs and security holes, or adapt it to new environments</p>

              <h5 class="card-title">Programming languages</h5>
              <p class="card-text">Different programming languages support different styles of programming (called programming paradigms). 
                The choice of language used is subject to many considerations, such as company policy, suitability to task, availability of 
                third-party packages, or individual preference. Ideally, the programming language best suited for the task at hand will be selected. 
                Trade-offs from this ideal involve finding enough programmers who know the language to build a team, the availability of 
                compilers for that language, and the efficiency with which programs written in a given language execute. Languages form an
                 approximate spectrum from "low-level" to "high-level"; "low-level" languages are typically more machine-oriented 
                 and faster to execute, whereas "high-level" languages are more abstract and easier to use but execute less quickly. 
                 It is usually easier to code in "high-level" languages than in "low-level" ones. Programming languages are essential 
                 for software development. 
                They are the building blocks for all software, from the simplest applications to the most sophisticated ones.
                Allen Downey, in his book How To Think Like A Computer Scientist, writes:
                The details look different in different languages, but a few basic instructions appear in just about every language:
                Input: Gather data from the keyboard, a file, or some other device.
                Output: Display data on the screen or send data to a file or other device.
                Arithmetic: Perform basic arithmetical operations like addition and multiplication.
                Conditional Execution: Check for certain conditions and execute the appropriate sequence of statements.
                Repetition: Perform some action repeatedly, usually with some variation.
                Many computer languages provide a mechanism to call functions provided by shared libraries. Provided the functions in a 
                library follow the appropriate run-time conventions (e.g., method of passing arguments), then these functions may be written 
                in any other language.</p>
